# Projects

A Machinable Project is a place to create and organize your application's API Resources, Collections of data, Users, and API Keys. Projects are created and managed by a Project Administrator. A project will have a unique hostname, `{project-slug}.machinable.io`, that will provide access to the project's resources.

## Use Cases

You can use a Machinable Project for many purposes:

* Build a prototype HTTP API quickly
* A Dummy HTTP API for test data
* Store valid JSON objects in an API Resource for your production application
* Provide a public API to open source data

Take a look at our growing list of [sample projects](/reference/sample_projects/) to get an idea of what you can use Machinable for.
