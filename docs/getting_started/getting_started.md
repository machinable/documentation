## Create A Project

After logging in for the first time you will see a fairly empty screen which invites you to create a new project. Click the 'Create A Project' button to get started.

### ![machinable register](../images/new_project.png)

Provide the necessary information for your project:

**Project Icon**

Select from multiple icons. This can help identify your project in the list.

**Name**

The short, but descriptive, name of your project.

**Slug**

This is the subdomain that will be given to your project in the form of `https://{project_slug}.machinable.io`.

**Description**

A longer description of your project. What are you using this project for? Are there any relevant links that this project should reference? Etc.

**Authentication Required**

This specifies if User/API Key authentication will be required to access the API Resource and Collection data stored for this project. If this is disabled, anyone with your project links can access the data. _This can be changed at any time_.

Once you have filled out the form, click 'Create'. Your project is now ready to use!
