Hi, my name is Nick Sjostrom / [anothrNick](https://github.com/anothrNick).

I created Machinable as a way to quickly bootstrap my projects' storage, REST APIs, and user management. I quickly realized that if this was useful to me, it may be useful to others as well.

If you have any feedback, issues, or comments regarding Machinable open an issue or send me an email at <nick@radicalwhale.com>
