## Welcome to Machinable!

Machinable gives developers the ability to create API Resources and Collections to store data in a structured, validated, RESTful way without having to write any backend code.

## Features

### API Resources

[API Resources](/projects/resources/) are defined endpoints that store structured data which is validated on creation based on the [JSON Schema]() that describes your application's data.

### Collections

[Collections](/projects/collections/) are lists of unstructured data. Store any JSON object in your collections without having to rely on data validation.

### User/API Key Access

Create API Keys to manage your project data and allow users to register to your project. Users then have access to API Resource and Collection data based on authorization policies that you configure.

## Goal

The goal of Machinable is to provide developers an abstraction to their project's CRUD HTTP APIs. This let's you focus on the important parts of your project; User experience and business logic.

With Machinable's combination of [CRUD interfaces](/querying_data/crud.md), Webhooks (TODO), and Websockets (TODO), developers can quickly develop prototypes or even full scale production applications. 

See our list of [open source sample applications](/reference/sample_projects.md) built on Machinable.
